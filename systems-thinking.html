    <h2>1. Causal Loop Diagram</h2>
    <p>This diagram shows how increased workload lowers morale, reduces productivity, and causes project delays — which then leads to even more workload. It's a reinforcing negative loop.</p>

    <h2>2. Systems Thinking Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      The diagram above represents the relationship between team morale and workload distribution. It shows how heavy workloads reduce morale, which then lowers productivity and causes delays. Those delays increase pressure, which leads to even more work — creating a harmful feedback loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems thinking helps leaders see these patterns and root causes instead of just treating symptoms. Rather than pushing the team harder when productivity drops, a leader can look at resource planning, communication, and support systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In real-world leadership, I would use this mindset to anticipate problems early and design solutions that avoid creating new issues down the line. Systems thinking leads to healthier teams and better long-term results.

    <h2>3. Engineering Decision Example</h2>
    <p>
      In a recent engineering project, a leader decided to increase the time spent on code review before launch. This delayed the release by a week but helped catch bugs early. In the end, it reduced user complaints and tech support issues while improving customer satisfaction. This is a great example of how one decision can impact many other parts of the system.
