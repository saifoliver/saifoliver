    <h1>Systems Thinking Toolkit</h1>

    <p>As an engineering leader, understanding systems thinking is essential to anticipate complexity, feedback loops, and long-term consequences. Here's a model that represents a balancing loop system.</p>

    <h2>Causal Loop Diagram</h2>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This exercise taught me that increasing work pressure without addressing quality improvements leads to a vicious cycle of rework and errors. By identifying leverage points, like allocating time for process improvement, we can stabilize systems and reduce unnecessary feedback loops. Systems thinking empowers leaders to look beyond surface problems and focus on root causes.</p>

    <h2>Example of a Systems-Based Engineering Decision</h2>
    <p>During a past internship, my team was rushing product testing to meet tight deadlines. The short-term gain led to increased product defects and higher returns. Applying systems thinking, we introduced a feedback loop where testing time was adjusted based on past error rates. This improved quality and reduced costs in the long run.</p>
