  <h2>2. Systems Thinking Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    The diagram represents the relationship between team morale and workload distribution. It highlights how heavy workloads lower morale, reduce productivity, and cause delays—creating a negative feedback loop.
    A systems thinking approach helps leaders focus on root causes and long-term effects. In real leadership, I would use this mindset to solve issues without making short-term fixes that create new problems.

  <h2>3. Engineering Decision Example</h2>
  <p>
    A team leader increased time for code reviews, causing a 1-week delay but catching bugs early. This improved quality, reduced user complaints, and cut long-term support costs—showing how one decision impacted multiple system areas.
