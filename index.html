    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>I’m an aspiring engineer and car enthusiast from Hyderabad. This website is where I’ll showcase my journey, projects, and passions.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Mohammad Saif Uddin. I am currently pursuing a degree in Engineering Management at Cumberland University.
      I come from Hyderabad, a culturally rich city known for its heritage, food, and innovation. I have a strong passion for 
      automobiles, motor engineering, and the creative world of YouTube content creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dream is to one day own a farm on a 3-acre ranch where I can live with my family and raise animals like hens, ducks, cats, dogs, 
      and horses. I envision a life where technology, creativity, and nature go hand-in-hand. In addition to my academic pursuits, 
      I find joy in car meets, driving around the city, learning about engines, and watching documentaries on both human and animal behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy gaming—especially titles like Assassin’s Creed and GTA V—and I’ve recently started learning the guitar. Working out and staying 
      physically active is also part of my routine. This site is a space where I’ll document my journey, showcase my projects, and share my passions.
